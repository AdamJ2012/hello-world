Hello, I'm Adam Schachte. I came here to learn more about programming, but I'll probably stay for the moon tacos I've heard about.

I also like drawing, swimming, bad puns, and finding glitches in videogames.

In high school, I used C, C++, Java, and ActionScript 2.0.

Recently, I've been using wikitext, Python, Panda3D, Photoshop, and multiple powers of two.
